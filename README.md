# AutomatedWateringDevice
A simple control system to automtaically water a plant, or group of plants. 

This system will utilize the Arduino UNO (rev3) or similar varients using the atmega328P as the brain and implement various sensors for data collection and control.

I/O Utilized: 

I2C Adapter: Connects the BME and LCD using less pins
BME280 Temp/Pressure Sensor: For local tempurature and Humidity
2x14 Matrix LCD: Infomration Display

Capacitive moisture Sensor: Detects moisture value of the soil
Hall Effect Sensor: Water level sensor
Speaker: Beeps when low water
5v Pump: Waters the plant

//Potentially added
Rotary Encoder: manually rotate through LCD screens





This system will also utilize 3D printed solutions for a water resivoir and a case for the arduino board and other sensors.
